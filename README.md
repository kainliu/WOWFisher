## About

It works in the lovely online game "World of Warcraft".

As you may suffer, fishing in world of warcraft stands for an endless iteration of `throwing a bait`, `waiting for a bite` and `pulling back the hook`.

I would like to chat and fishing at the same time, and therefore create this script, saving myself a lot of efforts.

## Auto fishing keyboard simulator 

It is an auto-run script depends on [Anjian.com](http://www.anjian.com/).

Please download it and import the script. The script is written in `VBscript` in `script` folder.

## Data visualization 

After collecting several day's data, I start to analyse on the points of hooks in the screen.

As shown above, most of the successful fishing points are located in a rectangle area in the center of the screen. 

According to this, script is imporved by narrowing searching area of the hook.
