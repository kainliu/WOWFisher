## About

It works in the lovely online game "World of Warcraft".

As you may know, fishing in wow is an endless iteration in `cast skill`, `wait for the bait`, `right click on the hook`.

The script will save you a lot of time in fishing.

## Auto fishing keyboard simulator 

It is an auto-run script depends on [QMacro](http://www.qmacro.com/).

Please download it and import the script. The script is written in `VBscript` in `script` folder.

## Data visualization 

After collecting several day's data, I start to analyse on the points of hooks in the screen.

As shown above, most of the successful fishing points are located in a rectangle area in the center of the screen. 

According to this, I imporved the script by retargeting search area.
