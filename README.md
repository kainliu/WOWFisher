## 关于

这是一个魔兽世界爱好者才懂的事儿。有朋友说你这不是外挂么，我这纯一不牟利的个人爱好，主要目的是在整个过程中体验一下`代码改变生活`的快乐。


## About

It works in online game "World of Warcraft".

As you may know, fishing in wow is an endless iteration in `cast skill`, `wait for the bait`, `right click on the hook`.

The script will save you a lot of time in fishing.

## Data visualization 

After collecting several day's data, I start to analyse on the points of hooks in the screen.

Please open `screenshot` for screenshots of the game interface.

Please open `data` for visualization result.



## Auto fishing keyboard simulator 

It is an auto-run script depends on [QMacro](http://www.qmacro.com/).

Please download it and import the script. The script is written in `VBscript` in `script` folder.
